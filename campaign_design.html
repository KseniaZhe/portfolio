          <p>When people are looking for a new home they are actually looking for more than just four walls. They are looking for a change in their lives. A change for the better.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-1 push pad-t-1-2 gutter max-length-l">
          <h3 class="peta push-0">Target audience</h3>
          <p>After a detailed research on the target audience, it was established that the people of this category are career oriented professionals in pursuit of a success-ful future and personal fulﬁ llment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-1 push pad-t-1-2 gutter max-length-l">
          <h3 class="peta push-0">Campaign objective</h3>
          <p>So the objective of the campaign is to understand what kind of change the target audience is looking for and show that Minto condos can help them achieve their goals.</p>

          <h3 class="peta push-0">Slogans</h3>
          <p class="push-0">Based on the aspirations of the target audience, three slogans were created:</p>
          <p class="push-0"><i>Unlock your future.</i></p>
          <p class="push-0"><i>Unlock your potential.</i></p>
          <p class="push-1-2"><i>Unlock your lifestyle.</i></p>
          <p class="push-0">Supported by a subtitle:</p>
          <p class="push-1-2"><i>Minto condos—built to inspire.</i></p>
          <p class="push-0">All the three slogans appeal directly to the objectives of the target audience and tie together the idea of unlocking a door to their new Minto condo with the idea of success, inspiration and bright future.</p>

It is fascinating how visual communication can influence people. You canâ€™t even explain why you like or hate something, but it makes you make a choice. Graphic design can help you understand something better or confuse you. It can connect to your emotions and suddenly you have feelings about something you just saw. Graphic design can play tricks with your mind. It can be an inspiring friend, an intimidating leader or your loud irritating neighbour.Loud or silent it is real. And it makes you choose. My choice is to create it.
